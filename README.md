# SQL-Injections-Payloads
SQL payloads
SQL Injection (SQLi) is a critical web security vulnerability that empowers malicious actors to manipulate the queries executed by an application on its connected database. This vulnerability provides attackers with the ability to access data that would typically be off-limits to them. This compromised data may encompass information belonging to other users or any data accessible by the application itself. In more severe cases, attackers can go a step further by altering or deleting this data, leading to persistent alterations in the application's content or functionality.

Furthermore, SQL injection can escalate beyond data manipulation, potentially leading to the compromise of the underlying server or other backend infrastructure. Additionally, attackers can employ SQL injection as a means to execute a denial-of-service attack, causing disruption to the targeted system or application.
